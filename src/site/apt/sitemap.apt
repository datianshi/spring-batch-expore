Spring Batch Site Map

* Overview

 * Main Site - high-level information and links to sub-projects
   (called "modules" in Maven speak):

  * Docs - reference documentation, user guides

  * Infrastructure - CI build and technical information

  * Integration Tests - reports on tests of infrastructure

  * Core - CI and technical information about core domain

  * Execution - CI and technical information about execution (implementation of core)

* Main Site

  * Splash page - welcome, mission statement, download links

  * Whitepaper (JavaOne presentation translated to HTML)

  * Occasional Articles (e.g. transactions)

  * Use Cases

  * Project Information (standdard Maven stuff)

    * Developers

    * Source Repository

    * License

    * etc.

* Documentation

  * Splash page - welcome, links to rest of reference docs.

  * User Guides (docbook, Spring branded reference guides - HTML, HTML
  Single Page and PDF).  Two choices: one big guide with parts as
  listed below, or multiple mini-guides.  The former is probably
  better.

  Maybe we could also break each of these down a bit more...

    * Infrastructure - How to use the core API

    * Simple Execution Environment

    * Partitioning Execution Environment

    * Other Execution Environments?
